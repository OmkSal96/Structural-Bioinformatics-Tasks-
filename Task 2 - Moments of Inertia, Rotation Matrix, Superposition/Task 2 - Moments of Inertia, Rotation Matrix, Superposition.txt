For the given two coordinate sets for two
protein models: 1 – coordinates of the Calpha
trace of the peptide 1zta. 2- same peptide, but
different NMR-model. The objective of this
exercise is to
– Compute the radius of gyration for both models
– optimally superimpose both models based on
aligning their respective moments of inertia
vectors
– Compute the RMSD

Tasks
• Compute the radius of gyration for both models.
• Translate and rotate the second model in such a way that the two models
are optimally superimposed.
– Compute the center of mass (Note: each “atom/bead” is assumed to have the
same mass).
– Center both models to the center of origin (0, 0, 0).
– Based on the provided moments of inertia vectors (refer InertisVectors.txt), rotate Model 2 in such a way that both sets of moments of inertia
vectors as well as the associated coordinates are superimposed.
Note:
– the moments of inertia vectors are pre-sorted; i.e. the first vector of
the first model needs to be rotated to match up the the first of the second model and so forth
– Try 180-degree rotational symmetry-solutions (+/-180 degrees)
– Write the new coordinate sets for both models into two new structure data
files (with identical header lines (first 2 lines) as in the original data file). Upon
loading them into a viewer software (unzip 2nd_HA_Addtl_C_Code.tar for xprot_exercise.c), both models should be
optimally superimposed as displayed)
– After superimposing the models, compute the RMSD
