# Structural-Bioinformatics-Tasks

This repository contains two tasks which I completed during my course 'Structural Bioinformatics'.

The first task was to calculate diheadral angles using the coordinates of the protein. The aim of this task was to understand how the dihedral angle calculation works.

The second task was to use calculate radius of gyration and rotation matrix in order to rotate and superimpose two molecules such that the RMSD is minimised.
